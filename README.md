# Pricing-Component-with-Toggle-Project

Project Overview: The objective of this project is to create a pricing component with toggle functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website will present different pricing plans, allowing users to toggle between them to compare features and prices. The pricing component will provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. 

 

Functional Requirements: 

Pricing Plans: 

Display multiple pricing plans with different features and prices. 

Each plan should include details such as plan name, price, and a list of features. 

One plan should be highlighted as the recommended or default option. 

Toggle Functionality: 

Implement a toggle switch that allows users to switch between pricing plans. 

When the user toggles to a different plan, the corresponding plan details should be displayed, including updated price and features. 

The toggled plan should be visually distinguished from the other plans to indicate the user's selection. 

Responsive Design: 

Ensure that the pricing component adapts to different screen sizes and remains visually appealing. 

The layout and design should be responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
